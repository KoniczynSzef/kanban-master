## Getting Started

You can run the project locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoniczynSzef/kanban-master.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using `bun`:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Install [Xata](https://xata.io/) globally on your machine:

```bash
npm install -g xata
```

4. Create a database using [Xata](https://xata.io/) and run the migrations:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

This will apply the migrations to the database.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm planning to add `Docker` support in the future.
> Hovewer, I haven't found a good way to implement containerizing the application with `Xata` and `Bun` yet.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch with the name of the feature you want to implement:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name # Replace `your-feature-name` with the name of your feature

# Or:
git branch -c feature/your-feature-name
```

I assume at this point you have already cloned the repository and installed the dependencies.

3. Make your changes and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

4. Push your changes to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

5. Create a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository.
